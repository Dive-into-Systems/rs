= How to create new Runestone Components

This documentation is a discriptive guide on how to create new components for Runestone. Known limitations include:

* [ ] Pretext not YET supported, still need to implement in HTML
* [ ] Server-side not YET explored: all answer checking managed on front-end; no functionality for sending data to our server
* [ ] Question timing is not YET explored

== Step 1: Setting up your repository
. Make sure that you have forked and cloned the repository
+
[source, console]
git clone git@github.com:Dive-into-Systems/RunestoneComponents.git
cd RunestoneComponents/
. Set up the virtual environment and install the dependencies
+
[source, console]
----
mkvirtualenv runestone-build

pip install nodeenv
nodeenv -p

npm install
----

== Step 2: Create new components
. Name your component
.. Have a full name discriptive for its function
.. Have an acronym as ```keyword``` for this component
. Create a component directory inside ```../runestone``` (Note: the suggestions below are not required but good as a convention)
.. *Recommended: Duplicate a most relevant component*
.. Name the directory as the keyword of the component ```../runestone/keyword```
.. It's good to have a subdirectory ```../runestone/keyword/css```
.. It's good to have a subdirectory ```../runestone/keyword/js```
.. Inside the ```../runestone/keyword/js``` subdirectory, it's good to have a JavaScript file for this component ```keyword.js```
. Add your component into keyword mapping
.. In ```../webpack.index.js``` file, add a keyword-source statement into ```module_map``` with syntax:
+
[source, javascript]
keyword: () => import("./runestone/keyword/js/keyword.js"),
+
Again, you do not need to match the names for folder, file, and keyword. To make the program knows how to map the keyword to corresponding implementation is the only goal.
.. In ```./runestone/keyword/js/keyword.js``` file, look for a code block with title "*Find the custom HTML tags and execute our code on them*" at the end of the file.
+
Set ```data-component``` to your ```keyword``` in the following line:
+
[source, javascript]
$("[data-component=keyword]").each(function (index) {
+
======
**Remarks:**

* Leave the following line unchanged for now (unless you are now comfortable working on exercise timing)
[source, javascript]
if ($(this).closest("[data-component=timedAssessment]").length == 0) {
* You must match your ```keyword``` in _3.a_ and _3.b_
======

== Step 3: Compile your component in an HTML test file
. Build the component with ```npm```, run from console:
[source, console]
npm run build
It will create ```webpack_static_imports.json``` in ```/runestone/dist``` directory. 
. Create an HTML file in ```../HTML_example```
.. *Recommended*: duplicate an existing HTML file
. In the body of the HTML file, create a ```<section>``` that contains a ```<div>``` with the ```data-component``` being tested, as the example shown below:
+
[source, html]
----
<section id="exercise name">
  <h1>Exercise Name<a class="headerlink" href="#component-abbreviation" title="Permalink to this heading">Â¶</a></h1>
            <p>Exercise Title </p>

        <div class="runestone ">
        <div data-component="keyword" data-question_label="a number" id="a unique id"  style="visibility: hidden;">
        </div>
        </div>
</section>
----
+
====
*Remark:*

The most important goal is to set ```data-component``` as your ```keyword``` such that Runestone knows to compile your component here.

Don't forget that you can configure some questions to your preference with ```JSON```.

Moreover, make sure question has a different ```id```. 
====
. Go into the ```../HTML_example``` folder and link required .js and .css files using the `link-runestone-js.py` script. 
+
[source, console]
----
cd HTML_example
./link-runestone-js.py ../runestone/dist/webpack_static_imports.json <name of your html file>
----
+
.. For the `link-runestone-js.py` script to work, it *must* find the following block
in the HTML file you passed it:
+
[source, html]
----
<!-- BEGIN LINKED FILES -->
...
<!-- END LINKED FILES -->
----
+
.. Anything in between those two markers (the `...` above) will be overwritten by
the script to include the runestone files you built.  All other lines will be
passed through without changes.

. Open the html file in a browser to check whether the component is rendered correctly or not. 

== Step 4: Integrating with Pretext

====
*Notice:*

By the time this documentation is written (Jul. 2023), we use ```<slate>``` or ```<iframe>``` to embed *each* question as an *individual* HTML. There are still unsolved problems including:

. unexpected scroll bar
. extraneous and repetitive code
====
. Make sure that you have pretext ready on your virtual environment
+
[source, console]
----
pip install pretext
----
+

Make sure you have also cloned and now looking at your ```DIS_Exercises``` repository. (Or refer to another document and create a new pretext book if you want to.)

. Create a ```*.ptx``` file
.. If it is a chapter-level exercise, put your ```\*.ptx``` file in ```DIS_Exercises/DIS_Pretext/source/``` folder. "Include" your ```*.ptx``` file in ```main.ptx```:
+
[source, pretext]
----
<xi:include href="./*.ptx"/>
----
+
.. You can also create a Chapter and put your exercise as a page in that chapter!
... Create a folder inside ```DIS_Exercises/DIS_Pretext/source/``` and add a ```toctree.ptx``` file in that folder. Your ```toctree.ptx``` should "include" all pages of exercise in that chapter:
+
[source, pretext]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<chapter xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xml:lang="en-US">
  <title>Your Title</title>
  <xi:include href="./*.ptx"/>
</chapter>
----
+
... Add the ```toctree.ptx``` file to ```main.ptx```
+
----
<xi:include href="./your_folder/toctree.ptx"/>
----
+
. Add your exercise to your ```*.ptx``` file.
.. Add built-in question-types just as instructions on RuneStone. Note that this would use RuneStone from official release.
.. Add your exercises built on your components:
... Likewise, your exercise should be wrapped by ```<exercise>``` label and you should include a ```<title>```.
... Write questions just like you would do in your HTML test file. You can directly use the code template below:
+
[source, pretext]
----
  <exercise label="test-cacheinfo">
    <title>Caching Info</title>

    <interactive xml:id="interactive-test2"
      platform="javascript"
      width="100%"
      aspect="8:9"
      source= "dist/jquery.js dist/runestone/runestone.js dist/runestone/vendors.js dist/runestone/runtime.js"
      css="dist/runestone/runestone.css dist/runestone/vendors.css">

      <slate xml:id="test_cache_info" surface="html"
        aspect="8:9">

          <script>
            eBookConfig = {};
          
            eBookConfig.useRunestoneServices = false;
            eBookConfig.host = 'http://127.0.0.1:8000' || 'http://127.0.0.1:8000';
            eBookConfig.app = eBookConfig.host+'/runestone';
            eBookConfig.course = 'testfitb';
            eBookConfig.basecourse = 'testfitb';
            eBookConfig.isLoggedIn = false;
            eBookConfig.enableCompareMe = eBookConfig.useRunestoneServices;
            eBookConfig.new_server_prefix = '';
          
            eBookConfig.ajaxURL = eBookConfig.app+'/ajax/';
            eBookConfig.logLevel = 0;
            eBookConfig.loginRequired = false;
            eBookConfig.build_info = "unknown";
            eBookConfig.python3 = false;
            eBookConfig.acDefaultLanguage = 'python' ? 'python' : 'python'
            eBookConfig.runestone_version = '6.6.2';
            eBookConfig.jobehost = 'http://jobe2.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz';
            eBookConfig.proxyuri_runs = '/jobe/index.php/restapi/runs/';
            eBookConfig.proxyuri_files = '/jobe/index.php/restapi/files/';
            eBookConfig.enable_chatcodes = false ? false : false;
            eBookConfig.enableScratchAC = true;
          </script>

          <div class="runestone ">
          <div data-component="cacheinfo" data-question_label="1" id="test_caching_info"  style="visibility: hidden;">
          </div>
          </div>

      </slate>
    </interactive>
  </exercise>
----
+
... Run the script ```/DIS_Exercises/DIS_Pretext/copy_runestone_bundles.py``` in terminal to copy your *already compiled* dist folder over.
+
[source, console]
----
./copy_runestone_bundles.py <path/to/runestone/dist> [path/to/destination/dist]
----
+
... Change directory to ```/DIS_Exercises/DIS_Pretext/```. Use pretext to build and view the book from terminal
+
[source, console]
----
pretext build web
pretext view web
----
+
. Now you are able to view the interactive textbook
