##CircuitVis:

There aren't any configuration options for this --- I couldn't think of a reason why they would be necessary.

There are three 'modes' on the component that represent circuit you can visualize: multiplexer, r-s latch, and a gated-d latch.

I currently have it so that the circuit JSON is logged when you toggle the circuit and am planning on removing this.

Also, it's worth noting that the multiplexer uses a different formatting set up so that I can straight manually-routed lines.
