= TODO list of our changes to RunestoneComponents

Add entries for features/functionality to add to different parts of core
code or to individual components.  When complete an item, check its box
and move to end of the list (rather than delete, so we can remember what
we have alread tested).  You could add a note to how tested or example
test code locations where appropriate.  

== Runestone Infrastructure

This is for any TODO changes and testing to RunestoneComponents outside of
the individual components, or that spans multiple components.  

== Individual Components

=== Number Conversion

This is the number conversion component. Student can practice number
conversion among different bases. 
Source code is in /runestone/numconv/js/numconv.js with /runestone/numconv/css/numconv.css and
/runestone/numconv/js/numconv-i18n.en.js .

 * Features/Functionality to Add:
   ** [ ] more context-specific feedback for wrong answers    

 * Testing: 

   ** correctness of conversions
     *** [ ] binary to unsigned
     *** [x] unsigned to binary
     *** [ ] binary to signed
     *** [ ] signed to binary
     *** [x] binary to hex
     *** [ ] hex to binary
     *** [ ] add more here ...


=== Cache Info

This is the cache info component. Students can practice their understanding of cache information,
through answering the size of cache data block (in bytes), the number of entries, and the number of lines 
in a given cache structure.
Source code is in /runestone/cache/js/cacheinfo.js with /runestone/cache/css/cache.css and
/runestone/cache/js/cache-i18n.en.js .

 * Features/Functionality to Add:
   ** [ ] more context-specific feedback for wrong answers  (wrong number of bits,
       incorrect address bits, ...)
   ** [ ] other features to add ...


 * Testing:
   ** [x] works correctly for different size addresses
   ** [ ] other things to test ...

=== Cache Partition

This is the cache partition component. Students can practice their understanding of how a cache
system partitions a memory address into different parts.
Source code is in /runestone/cache/js/cachepartition.js with /runestone/cache/css/cache.css and
/runestone/cache/js/cache-i18n.en.js .

 * Features/Fuctionality to Add:
   ** [ ] more context-specific feedback for wrong answers  (wrong number of bits,
       incorrect address bits, ...)
   ** [ ] other features to add ...

 * Testing:
   ** [ ] works correctly for different size addresses
   ** [ ] other things to test ...

==== Direct Mapped (add subsection if it makes sense to break it up in this way)

This is the direct mapped mode of cache table component. 
Source code is in /runestone/cache/js/cachetable.js with /runestone/cache/css/cache.css and
/runestone/cache/js/cache-i18n.en.js . 
By default the mode of cache table is direct mapped. To specify, 
add line "cache-org": "Direct-Mapped" to the option json scripts. 

 * Features/Functionality to Add:
   ** [ ] more specific feedback
   ** [ ] add more guidance
   ** [ ] build a more user-friendly interface

 * Question Quality analysis
   ** [ ] understand the difference between different algorithms
   ** [ ] decide which algorithm we want to use
   ** [ ] try out dynamic parameterizing in bound algorithm

 * Testing:
   ** [ ] works correctly for different address sizes
   ** [ ] works correctly for evicting 
   ** [ ] valid generation

==== 2-Way Set Associative (add subsection if it makes sense to break it up in this way)

This is the 2-way set associative mode of cache table component. 
Source code is in /runestone/cache/js/cachetable.js with /runestone/cache/css/cache.css and
/runestone/cache/js/cache-i18n.en.js . 
By default the mode of cache table is direct mapped. To switch to 2-way set associative mode, 
add line "cache-org": "2-Way Set Associative" to the option json scripts. 

 * Features/Functionality to Add:
   ** [ ] more specific feedback
   ** [ ] build a more user-friendly interface
   ** [ ] try to reduce the number of input fields requires to fill
   ** [ ] add more guidance
   ** [ ] develop other random generation algorithms

 * Question Quality Analysis:
   ** [ ] find statistics that are more unique to set associative

 * Testing:
   ** [ ] works correctly for different adress sizes
   ** [ ] works correctly for evicting 
   ** [ ] determines LRU correctly
   ** [ ] valid generation
